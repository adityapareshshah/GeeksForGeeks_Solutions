Ishaan has been given a task by his teacher. He is given an integer N and asked to find some integer K for which N%K is the largest ( 1 <= K < N), where % stands for modulo.Ishaan has to complete this task as soon as possible, so help him do this.

Input : 
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.Each test case contains an integer N.

Output : 
For each test case, print the required answer in a new line.

Constraints : 
1 <= T <= 200
2 <= N <= 10^12

Example : 
Input : 
3
7
8
6
Output : 
4
5
4

Explanation : 
Case 1 : 
7%1 = 0
7%2 = 1
7%3 = 1
7%4 = 3
7%5 = 2
7%6 = 1

Case 2 : 
8%1 = 0
8%2 = 0
8%3 = 2
8%4 = 0
8%5 = 3
8%6 = 2
8%7 = 1
