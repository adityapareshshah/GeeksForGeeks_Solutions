Ishaan loves playing football. He is a penalty master as he practices a lot. Now during a match he wants to know how many goals does he score during a penalty.
Since he wants to focus on the match, he asks you to count the goals for him. You are given a string which consists of 3 different characters :
"0" stands for "no goal".
"1" stands for "goal".
"2" stands for a foul which gives Ishaan a penalty.
Note : You need to count only those goals which are scored on a penalty.

Input : 
First line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains a string S.

Output : 
For each test case, print the required answer in a new line.

Constraints : 
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Length of String <= 500

Example : 
Input : 
3
101201212110
10101
2120
Output : 
2
0
1

Explanation : 
Case 1 : 
101201212110
We consider only those goals which are after a penalty.
101201212110
There are 3 penalties, of which he scores only 2.

Case 2 : 
10101
Since there is no penalty in this match, answer is 0.

Case 3 : 
2120
We consider only those goals which are after a penalty.
2120
There are 2 penalties, of which he scores only 1.

Solution:
/*package whatever //do not write package name here */

import java.util.*;


class GFG {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		int T = s.nextInt();
		while(T>0)
		{   int count=0;
		    char[]str=s.next().toCharArray();
		    //System.out.println("Length of char array"+str.length);
		    for(int i=0;i<str.length-1;i++)
		    {
		    //	System.out.println("Current Value"+str[i]);
		        if(str[i]=='2')
		        {
		            if (str[i+1]=='1')
		            count++;
		        }
		    }
		    
		    System.out.println(count);
		  T--;
		}
		s.close();
	}
